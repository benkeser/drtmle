Title: Estimation and inference for doubly robust, asymptotically linear TMLE
    estimates
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("David", "Benkeser", email = "benkeser@berkeley.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package implements TMLE estimators that are doubly robust
    with respect both to consistency and asymptotic linearity. Thus, the inference
    provided by the estimators is also doubly robust.
