\title{Super learner wrapper for kernel regression}
\usage{
SL.npreg(Y, X, newX, family, obsWeights, rangeThresh = 1e-07, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A vector of outcomes.}

\item{X}{A matrix or data.frame of training data predictors.}

\item{newX}{A test set of predictors.}

\item{family}{Not used by the function directly, but ensures compatibility with \code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{obsWeights}{Not used by the function directly, but ensures compatibility with \code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{rangeThresh}{If the the range of the outcomes is smaller than this number, the method
returns the empirical average of the outcomes. Used for computational expediency and stability.}

\item{...}{Other arguments (not currently used).}
}
\description{
Kernel regression based on the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/np/}{np}
package. Uses leave-one-out cross-validation to fit a kernel regression. 
See \code{?npreg} for more details.
